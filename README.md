# watch_er 🎥
### Introduction
The goal of my watcher program is to detect video camera footage and decipher what's happening on screen using existing frameworks like Googles Mediapipe and then make some functioning code from the readings. - 🤳
### Features 
The current application can be downloaded and run on any IDE and hardware that has camera access and the prerequistes, the code currently executes and displays Mediapipe's face and hand landmarks on screen however no code is set up after that to function anything. The code imports Media pipe into two different files, hand and face tracking modules and then uses a main tracking file to run the code together. - 😀
### Working on
I plan to make the next version output whatever number you have held up at the camera. - 🏢
## Bugs
I haven't found too many bugs, but depending on your camera and the light in your environment it could make it significantly harder for Mediapipe to recognise and track landmarks - 🐛
## libs
https://opencv.org/ - The library required for accessing the camera.

https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/guide - The library required for Googles, Mediapipe algos.
